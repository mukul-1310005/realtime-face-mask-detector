# realtime-face-mask-detector
A live video stream will detect whether the person in the video is wearing face mask or not.

The dataset I used contains 690 images if people not wearing mask and 686 images of people wearing mask. Link to dataset can be found in file called "Dataset"

The model used in making of this project is MobileNet V2.
MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture that seeks to perform well on mobile devices. It is based on an inverted residual structure where the residual connections are between the bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. As a whole, the architecture of MobileNetV2 contains the initial fully convolution layer with 32 filters, followed by 19 residual bottleneck layers.

I want to say thank you to person who helped me In making of this project
